# Cooling Tower Synthetic Data Generator Project

### Synthetic Data Generator TODO:
- ensure all synthetic data generation is deterministic using seeds!
- find new way to algorithmically grow dust spots (more linear).
- (maybe) depending on above algorithm, incorporate script C into script A.
- (when there is time) restructure and reorganize all utils for this directory.

### Academic Paper TODO:
- Touch up method_diagram so that arrows don't directly cross (use jump).
